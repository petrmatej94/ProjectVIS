# Project for subject Information System Development
Project is divided into two parts - Desktop and Web application. The main focus of this subject was separating individual parts of SW into Three-tier (layer) architecture and also using Design Patterns. One of requirements was also using of two sources of data - SQL and XML, and possibility to switch between them.

Details below were for my teacher.
## Desktop App
- Folder *ProjectVIS*
- 2 UC implemented 
- - Process payment at drivers profile (login as driver)
- - Create new record as Employee (you can use drivers login below)

## MVC Web
- Folder *MVCWeb*
- 2 UC implemented 
- - Process payment at drivers profile (login as driver)
- - Automaticaly create record (SPZ: 3G5 4784, speed: 0..n) (SPZ is with space in the middle...)

## Logins
- Driver login: 154875, password: pass
- Employee login: 1, password: pass


## Change Repository
- MVC Web has implemented "Automatical create record" with possible saving data as XML & SQL
- Settings can be changed at *ProjectVIS*/Program/Settings.cs
